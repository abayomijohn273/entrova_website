Depending on your location, some payment methods may not be available to you, and we cannot guarantee that you will be able to use any payment method in connection with the Services even in locations where your preferred payment method is available for use. Depending on the desired payment method, Users may be required to enter into a separate agreement with the applicable Payment Service Provider (“Payment Service Provider Agreement”).

Users should verify the accuracy and completeness of the information on the forms before submitting them to other Users or to any tax authority. By using Entrova to generate and sign Forms, you represent and warrant that the information you have provided is accurate and complete, and specifically to the terms of Section 12 regarding electronic signatures.</p><br/><p>We use a third party service to enable you to file your 1099 at the end of each tax year.</p><br/><p>We also generate and submit invoices to Clients on behalf of Contractors when payment is due.

Appointment of Entrova as Payment Agent.</p><br/><p>Contractors and Client employees (each a “Payee” for purposes of this Section) hereby appoint Entrova as their limited authorized payment collection agent (“Payment Agent”) solely for the purpose of facilitating the receipt of payments (via its Payment Services Provider, if applicable) from Clients for Services provided in connection with Contracts or their employment.</p><br/><p>Payee agrees that payment received from Clients by Entrova will be considered the same as payment made directly to Payee, regardless of whether Entrova remits or fails to remit the payment to Payee.

Clients’ payment obligations to Payee will be satisfied upon receipt of payment by Entrova (or its Payment Service Provider, as applicable), and Entrova (via its Payment Service Provider, as applicable) will be responsible for remitting funds to Payee in the manner described in these Terms of Service. In the event that Entrova (via its Payment Service Provider) does not remit any such amounts to a Payee, the Payee will have recourse for non-payment solely against Entrova, and not Clients. Payee agrees that Entrova may describe or otherwise reflect the terms contained herein in any terms of service, receipts, disclosures, or notices including, but not limited to, receipts provided to Clients that Entrova may deem necessary or prudent.</p><br/><p class="font-medium text-lg">10.5. Payments to Contractors.</p><br/><p>Clients may pay Contractors in any of Entrova&#x27;s supported currencies. Unless Client instructs Entrova otherwise, Client will be charged in the currency indicated on the applicable Contract, in the event a Client elects to pay in another currency, the exchange rate will be calculated using forward foreign exchange rates available to Entrova and the maturity of the forward will be selected based on payment date of the relevant Contract with such Contractor. In any event, the actual payment amount, in the actual payment currency will be clearly disclosed to the Client before the Client completes the payment. Contractors may elect to be paid in any one of Entrova&#x27;s supported currencies.

Deliverables will be considered work-for-hire under the U.S. Copyright Act. If Deliverables do not meet the requirements of work-for-hire or when the US Copyright Act does not apply, the Contractor will expressly agree to assign to Client the copyright to the Deliverables. All transfer and assignment of intellectual property to Client will be subject to full payment pursuant to the relevant Contract terms. Clients may not use the Deliverables if payment is not made in full or the Contract is cancelled for any reason. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for custom Deliverables (such as art work, design work, report generation, etc.), the Deliverables will be the exclusive property of the Client, and the Contractor assigns all rights, title and interest in the Deliverables to the Client. Contractors further confirm that whatever information they receive from the Client that is not in the public domain, will be kept confidential and will not be shared or used for any purpose whatsoever other than for the delivery of the Deliverables or performance of services for the Client pursuant to the Contract.</p></div><div class="mb-8"><h3 class="text-primary text-xl lg:text-2xl mb-4 font-bold">11.
